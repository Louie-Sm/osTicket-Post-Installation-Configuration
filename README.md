<p>
Roles are the permissions granted to Agents per Department that they have access to. Each Role has a set of permissions that can be checked/unchecked for agents given that Role in association with a Department they have access to. An unlimited number of roles can be created and assigned to Agents with access to various departments.
  
To create roles you will first need to log in as an admin into OSticket, from there ensure you are in the admin Panel and you will select Agents -> roles
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
In the Definition tab you will name the role and add any internal notes you deem necessary. For our example we will be creating a supreme admin account so in the Permissions tab select all of the abilities in “ticket” “tasks” “Knowledgeable”

After you have selected all desired permissions you can then select add role and you will see the new role added.

</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
After that we will create a new SLA Plan or Service Level Agreements, these are unlimited in osTicket. The purpose of the SLA Plan is to provide a length of time in which the help desk Administrator expects tickets to be closed.

We will navigate to the Manage tab and select SLA -> Add New SLA
</p>
<br />

<p>

</p>
<p>
From there we can create a Plan name to be selected when assigning In the Name field then filling in the rest of the filed to your specified desire: 
  
**Grace Period:** Amount, in hours, before tickets with this SLA will become overdue if not closed in allotted time.
  
**Status:** Choose Active or Disable for the plan.
  
**Transient:** SLA can be overridden on ticket transfer or help topic change; if not transient, the SLA will remain the same as it is assigned on ticket creation.
  
**Ticket Overdue Alerts:** This will DISABLE overdue alert notices to staff for tickets assigned this SLA.
</p>
<br />

<p>

Since tickets are routed through Departments in the help desk Next we will create departments 

Start by making sure you are in the admin panel, select the agents tab and click on Departments-> “add new Department”
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>

From here we can fill out the  Department Information:<br />
We can refrence the forum:
[osTicket Documents](https://docs.osticket.com/en/latest/Admin/Agents/Departments.html) 
to see what each field means and what it does and fill in the appropriate information.
after we're done select “Create Dept” to finish

</p>
<p>
Teams allow you to pull Agents from different Departments and organize them to handle a specific issue or user via a Help Topic or Ticket Filter.<br />
Having Agents from different Departments assigned to a Team will supersede the parameters of the Agents’ Department rules.<br /> <br /> For example, you can create a Help Topic associated with a particular product you produce, and assign it to a Team of specialist Agents from different Departments.<br />
To create a Team in your Admin Panel Begin by selecting the agents tab and click on Teams-> “add new Team”
</p>
<br />

<p>

<br />

Next we will configure our settings to make sure we allow anyone to create tickets without having to register by going to the admin panel selecting the settings tab and navagating to the user section and masking sure the “Registration Required:” box is not ticked and “Registration Method:” is set to Public
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
Agents are given access to the help desk with the intent to respond and resolve the tickets. When adding an Agent to the help desk, they will need to be assigned to a Primary Department and given a Primary Role for the Tickets/Tasks routed to that department. <br /> Agents can be given Extended Access to additional departments of the help desk as well as assigned different Roles to those departments; this can be configured in the Access tab of the Agent’s Profile.
</p>
<br />

<p>
Next we will add users Users are the ticket owners of the tickets in the help desk. When a ticket is created in the help desk, the user is associated with their email address in the User Directory of the help desk. Users can be added or deleted from the User Directory of the help desk at any time. Please note, if the user is deleted the tickets of the user must also be deleted.<br /> To add a user we will first make sure we are in the Agent Panel then we will navigate to the Users tab and select user directory -> add new user
</p>
<br />
